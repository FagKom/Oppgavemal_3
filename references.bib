@article{Tomonaga1950,
	abstract = {The fact implied by Bloch several years ago that in some approximate sense the behavior of an assembly of Fermi particles can be described by a quantized field of sound waves in the Fermi gas, where the sound field obeys Bose statistics, is proved in the one-dimensional case. This fact provides us with a new possibility of treating an assembly of Fermi particles in terms of the equivalent assembly of Bose particles, namely, the assembly of sound quanta. The field equation for the sound wave is found to be linear irrespective of the absence or presence of mutual interaction between particles, so that this method is a very useful means of dealing with many-Fermion problems. It is also applicable to the case where the interparticle force is not weak. In the case of force of too short a range this method fails.},
